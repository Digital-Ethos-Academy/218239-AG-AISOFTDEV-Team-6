- **Authors:** [Your Name], [Other Contributors]

## Context

The AI meeting assistant project requires a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend framework. The backend must efficiently handle high concurrency, integrate seamlessly with AI/ML models, ensure security, and support rapid development and iteration. As the system is expected to process real-time audio, generate summaries, and interact with various third-party services, the framework's performance, extensibility, and developer productivity are critical. 

Several leading backend frameworks were evaluated against the following criteria:

- **Scalability & Performance:** Ability to handle high-concurrency and low-latency workloads.
- **Ease of Use:** Developer friendliness, documentation, and learning curve.
- **Community Support:** Availability of help, libraries, and ongoing development.
- **Integration:** Ease of integrating with databases, AI/ML models, authentication, and external services.
- **Cost:** Licensing, hosting, and operational efficiency.
- **Security:** Built-in features and ease of implementing secure APIs.
- **Flexibility:** Ability to support diverse requirements and integrate Python libraries.

The frameworks considered were Node.js/Express, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, and FastAPI. Each option was analyzed for suitability to the unique needs of an AI meeting assistant.

## Decision

**FastAPI** is selected as the backend framework for the AI meeting assistant project.

FastAPI is a modern, asynchronous Python web framework that excels in performance, scalability, and developer experience. Its async-first design, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and compatibility with Python's rich AI/ML ecosystem make it especially suitable for the project's real-time and AI-centric requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **High Scalability & Performance:** Async architecture and ASGI support enable FastAPI to efficiently handle high-concurrency workloads, suitable for real-time voice and AI operations.
- **Developer Productivity:** Type annotations, minimal boilerplate, and automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation significantly reduce onboarding time and improve maintainability.
- **Strong Integration Capabilities:** Native support for async Python allows seamless integration with AI/ML models and modern databases; works well with third-party authentication and external APIs.
- **Efficient Operations:** FastAPI’s performance and low resource consumption reduce hosting costs, and Python hosting is widely available and affordable.
- **Security:** Built-in utilities for OAuth2, JWT, and CORS simplify secure API development.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both synchronous and asynchronous code, and easily extends with Python’s ecosystem of libraries.
- **Active Community:** Rapidly growing support, especially in AI and data science communities.

### Negative Consequences

- **Relatively New Ecosystem:** FastAPI is newer compared to frameworks like Django or Express, so it has fewer mature plugins and resources.
- **Potential Knowledge Gap:** Team members unfamiliar with async Python or type annotations may require training.
- **Evolving Best Practices:** As the community is still growing, best practices and official patterns are still maturing.
