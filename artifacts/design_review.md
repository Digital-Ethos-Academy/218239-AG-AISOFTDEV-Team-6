As a meticulous UI/UX designer, I have conducted a thorough comparison between the provided design image and the refactored React code. The code provides a functional and well-structured implementation that captures the essence of the design. However, several specific visual and stylistic details deviate from the original design.

Here is a point-by-point breakdown of the discrepancies, with suggestions for improvement to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy.

### General Assessment
The refactored code successfully implements the core layout, component structure, and functionality. The use of components like `FeatureToggle`, `ToggleSwitch`, and `Button` is excellent for reusability. The main areas for improvement lie in fine-tuning the typography, color palette, spacing, and, most notably, the iconography to precisely match the design mock-up.

### Detailed List of Discrepancies

#### 1. Typography and Spacing
*   **Header Font Size:** The `<h1>` for "Momentum" uses `text-5xl` (3rem or 48px), which is noticeably larger than in the design. The design's header is prominent but more balanced with the other elements.
    *   **Recommendation:** Reduce the font size. `text-4xl` (2.25rem or 36px) would be a closer match.
*   **Header Margin:** The `mb-12` (3rem or 48px) creates a larger gap between the "Momentum" title and the first toggle item than what is shown in the design.
    *   **Recommendation:** Reduce the bottom margin to `mb-8` (2rem or 32px) or `mb-10` (2.5rem or 40px) to tighten the vertical rhythm.
*   **Feature Label Font Weight:** The code uses `font-medium` for the feature labels ("Scheduler", etc.), which is a good choice. However, the design's font appears slightly bolder and has a different anti-aliasing feel, suggesting it might be a specific font family. While `font-medium` is acceptable, `font-semibold` might also be tested to see if it's a closer match. For now, `font-medium` is a reasonable approximation.

#### 2. Color Palette
*   **Primary Blue Color:** The code uses Tailwind's default `bg-blue-500`. This blue is more saturated and vibrant than the softer, slightly desaturated blue used in the design for the primary button ("Get transcript") and the active toggle switch.
    *   **Recommendation:** Define a custom color in the `tailwind.config.js` file that matches the design's hex code (e.g., something closer to `#4A80E5` or a similar shade) and apply it. Alternatively, use a different default shade like `bg-indigo-500` or `bg-cornflower-blue` if available, but a custom color is best.
*   **Border Colors:** The `FeatureToggle` items use `border-gray-200`, while the secondary `Button` uses `border-gray-300`. In the design, the border color on all elements appears to be a single, consistent, and very light shade of gray.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a consistent border color for both components. `border-gray-200` is likely the better choice for both to match the subtlety of the design's border.

#### 3. Iconography
This is the most significant area of deviation. The icons in the code are functionally similar but stylistically different from the custom, cleaner icons in the design.

*   **Scheduler Icon:** This is the closest match. However, the `strokeWidth="1.5"` in the code results in lines that are slightly thinner than in the design.
    *   **Recommendation:** Increase the `strokeWidth` to `"2"` to give the icon more presence, matching the design's visual weight.

*   **Facilitator Icon:** The implemented SVG is significantly more complex than the one in the design.
    *   **Design:** Features a simple, clean person silhouette with a single-arc headphone band.
    *   **Code:** The SVG has a more detailed head shape, a broken headphone band to accommodate the head's outline, and rectangular microphone blocks below the earpieces.
    *   **Recommendation:** Replace the current SVG with one that more faithfully reproduces the simple, elegant design of the original icon.

*   **Transcriber Icon:** The implemented icon deviates in its core representation.
    *   **Design:** Shows a document with lines and a simple speaker/audio icon in the bottom right corner.
    *   **Code:** The SVG shows a document but replaces the speaker icon with a more complex set of symbols resembling a "play/pause" or "seek" interface.
    *   **Recommendation:** Replace the current SVG with one that features the simple speaker icon as shown in the design to accurately convey the "transcription" or "audio" aspect.

#### 4. Component Details
*   **Toggle Switch:** The `ToggleSwitch` is very well implemented and closely matches the design's mechanics and appearance. No changes are needed here.
*   **Buttons and Feature Cards:** The `rounded-xl` and `shadow-sm` on the cards are excellent choices that match the design's soft corners and subtle depth. The button padding (`py-4`) also creates the correct chunky, tappable feel. These are well done.

### Summary of Recommendations

| Element/Area         | Discrepancy                                                               | Recommended Change                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header**           | Font size is too large (`text-5xl`).                                      | Change to `text-4xl`.                                                                                                                               |
| **Header Spacing**   | Bottom margin is too large (`mb-12`).                                     | Change to `mb-8` or `mb-10`.                                                                                                                        |
| **Colors**           | Primary blue (`blue-500`) is too saturated.                               | Use a custom, softer blue color (e.g., `#4A80E5`) for the primary button and active toggle.                                                        |
| **Icons**            | **Facilitator** & **Transcriber** SVGs do not match the design's style. | Replace the SVGs with custom ones that are simpler and match the design exactly.                                                                    |
| **Icons**            | Icon stroke weight (`1.5`) is too thin.                                   | Increase `strokeWidth` to `"2"` for all icons to match the visual weight in the design.                                                             |
| **Borders**          | Inconsistent border colors (`gray-200` vs `gray-300`).                    | Use a consistent `border-gray-200` for both `FeatureToggle` cards and the secondary `Button`.                                                       |
