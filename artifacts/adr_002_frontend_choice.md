# Architectural Decision Record: Frontend Framework Choice - React

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2023-10-27
- **Decision ID:** ADR-001
- **Authors:** The Frontend Engineering Team

## Context

The development of our new AI-powered meeting assistant requires a robust and modern frontend framework. The application's user interface must be highly interactive and capable of handling real-time data streams, such as live transcriptions, AI-generated suggestions, and dynamic agenda updates. Key technical requirements include a rich component-based UI, efficient real-time data handling, complex state management, high performance, and seamless integration with third-party APIs (e.g., Zoom, Google Calendar).

A decision is necessary to select a single, primary framework to ensure consistency, maintainability, and development velocity for the project's lifecycle.

The alternatives considered during our research were:
*   **Vue.js:** Praised for its gentle learning curve, excellent documentation, and integrated tooling.
*   **Svelte:** A compiler-based framework offering potentially superior performance and smaller bundle sizes due to its "no Virtual DOM" approach.
*   **Angular:** A comprehensive, opinionated framework by Google, excellent for large-scale enterprise applications with strong support for TypeScript and RxJS for reactive programming.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt **React** as the frontend framework for the AI meeting assistant application.

This decision includes leveraging the broader React ecosystem for key functionalities. We will use React's component architecture with Hooks and JSX to build the UI, and we will select mature, well-supported libraries for state management (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit), data fetching (e.g., React Query), and UI components (e.g., Material-UI or Ant Design).

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Accelerated Development:** React's massive ecosystem provides access to a vast array of pre-built, production-ready libraries for UI components, state management, routing, and data fetching. This significantly reduces the need to build foundational features from scratch.
- **Large Talent Pool:** React is the most popular frontend library, which simplifies hiring and onboarding new developers, mitigating long-term project risk.
- **Proven Scalability:** React is used to power some of the world's largest and most complex web applications. Its component-based architecture is proven to be effective for building and maintaining large, scalable codebases.
- **Community Support:** Any technical challenge encountered is likely to have been solved and documented by the extensive global community, reducing troubleshooting time.
- **Flexibility:** As a library, React offers the flexibility to choose the best supporting tools for our specific needs, allowing us to adapt our stack as the application evolves without being locked into a rigid framework structure.

### Negative Consequences

- **Decision Overhead:** React's unopinionated nature means our team is responsible for making more architectural decisions regarding state management, routing, and project structure. This requires strong technical leadership to ensure consistency and avoid "decision fatigue."
- **Potential for Inconsistency:** The flexibility that allows for choosing a custom stack can lead to an inconsistent codebase if clear conventions and patterns are not established and enforced from the outset.
- **Ecosystem Learning Curve:** While React's core concepts are straightforward, mastering the broader ecosystem and best practices for integrating various libraries (e.g., state management, data fetching) requires dedicated learning and experience.
