## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
Momentum is an intelligent, AI-powered platform designed to automate the entire meeting lifecycle, from scheduling and preparation to real-time transcription, automated note-taking, and seamless follow-up. We are building Momentum to solve the universal problem of inefficient, poorly documented, and non-inclusive meetings that drain productivity. Our vision is to transform meetings from a necessary chore into a focused, productive, and collaborative engine for progress, where every outcome is captured and every voice is heard.

## 2. The Problem
*A detailed look at the pain points this product will solve. This section justifies the project's existence.*

**2.1. Problem Statement:**
Professionals across all industries waste significant time on manual meeting administration (scheduling, note-taking, follow-up) and struggle with unproductive meeting dynamics. This fragmentation leads to lost productivity, forgotten action items, decreased team engagement, and a lack of a searchable, reliable record of decisions.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**
*Summarize the key user personas affected by this problem. For each persona, describe a typical scenario they face that highlights the problem.*

- **Persona 1: Sarah, The Project Manager**
    - **Scenario:** Sarah leads multiple daily stand-ups and stakeholder meetings. She finds it impossible to actively facilitate the discussion while simultaneously trying to capture every critical decision, action item, and blocker. As a result, important tasks are sometimes missed, and she spends an extra 30-60 minutes after her meetings compiling and distributing notes.

- **Persona 2: Dr. Ahmed, The University Researcher**
    - **Scenario:** Dr. Ahmed collaborates with researchers in Tokyo, Berlin, and San Francisco. Scheduling a single meeting requires a long chain of emails to find a suitable time, and he often forgets to attach the latest research paper as a pre-read, leading to unprepared attendees and wasted meeting time.

- **Persona 3: Priya, The Executive Assistant**
    - **Scenario:** Priya supports two C-level executives and is responsible for documenting all board meetings. The process of creating formal, accurate minutes is tedious and time-consuming. Sharing these records and ensuring they are archived and searchable in the company's knowledge base is an entirely manual process.

- **Persona 4: James, The Remote Team Lead**
    - **Scenario:** James manages a fully remote team and notices that a few dominant voices tend to control conversations, while quieter, more introverted members rarely contribute, even though he knows they have valuable ideas. He lacks an effective, non-confrontational tool to encourage more balanced participation.

- **Persona 5: Maria, The New Hire**
    - **Scenario:** In her first few weeks, Maria joins complex project meetings filled with acronyms and history she doesn't know. She struggles to follow the conversation, understand who is responsible for what, and feels hesitant to interrupt to ask for clarification, slowing down her onboarding process.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
*How will we measure success? This section defines the specific, measurable outcomes we expect.*

| Goal | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Increase Meeting Productivity | Time spent on post-meeting admin (notes, summaries) | Reduce by 50% for active users |
| Improve Meeting Outcomes | Percentage of identified action items captured | Achieve 98% capture rate in transcripts |
| Enhance Meeting Inclusivity | Post-meeting user survey score on "participation equity" | Achieve an average score of 4.5/5 |
| Drive Product Adoption | Weekly Active Users (WAU) | Reach 1,000 WAU within 3 months of launch |

## 4. Functional Requirements & User Stories
*The core of the PRD. This section details what the product must do, broken down into actionable user stories.*

---
### **Epic: Meeting Transcription & Intelligence**
*Focuses on the core functionality of capturing and understanding meeting content.*

*   **Story US-001:** As a Project Manager (Sarah), I want the Note-Taker agent to automatically transcribe meeting discussions, identify speakers, and extract action items so that I can focus on leading the meeting and ensure all decisions and tasks are accurately captured.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** a meeting in progress, **when** the Note-Taker agent is active, **then** it transcribes all spoken words in real time, labels each speaker, and highlights action items and decisions in the notes.

*   **Story US-003:** As an Executive Assistant (Priya), I want the Note-Taker agent to generate accurate, searchable meeting minutes and sync them to our team tools so that I can quickly review, share, and archive meeting records for executives.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** a completed meeting, **when** the Note-Taker agent finishes processing, **then** it generates a summary with action items, allows keyword search within the transcript, and syncs the notes to connected Slack, email, and project management apps.

*   **Story US-005:** As a New Hire (Maria), I want the unified dashboard to display live notes, agenda progress, and action items during meetings so that I can easily follow along, understand the meeting flow, and participate confidently.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** an active meeting, **when** the user accesses the dashboard, **then** it displays real-time transcribed notes, the current agenda topic, elapsed time, and a list of action items as they are identified.

---
### **Epic: Scheduling & Preparation**
*Focuses on pre-meeting organization and efficiency.*

*   **Story US-002:** As a University Researcher (Dr. Ahmed), I want the Scheduler agent to coordinate meeting times across multiple time zones and send out agendas in advance so that my international collaborators and students can easily attend and prepare for meetings.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** a list of participants with different time zones, **when** a meeting needs to be scheduled, **then** the Scheduler agent finds and suggests optimal times, sends calendar invites upon confirmation, and distributes the attached agenda to all attendees at least 24 hours before the meeting.

---
### **Epic: In-Meeting Facilitation**
*Focuses on real-time intelligence to improve meeting dynamics.*

*   **Story US-004:** As a Remote Team Lead (James), I want the Facilitator agent to monitor participation and prompt quieter team members to contribute so that all voices are heard and meetings are more inclusive.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** an ongoing meeting, **when** the Facilitator agent detects that certain participants have not spoken for a configurable period, **then** it privately prompts those participants (or the host) to encourage sharing, and provides analytics on speaker time distribution post-meeting.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
*The qualities of the system. These are just as important as the functional requirements.*

-   **Performance:** Real-time transcription must appear with less than 2-second latency. The user dashboard must load in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
-   **Security:** All user data, including transcripts and recordings, must be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256). The system must support SAML-based SSO for corporate clients and comply with GDPR and CCPA standards.
-   **Accessibility:** The user interface must be compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities.
-   **Scalability:** The platform must support up to 10,000 concurrent meetings during peak usage hours.
-   **Reliability & Accuracy:** The speech-to-text transcription service must maintain a word error rate (WER) of less than 5% on clear audio. The system must have 99.9% uptime.
-   **Integrations:** The system must provide robust, authenticated API connections for third-party tools, initially prioritizing Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and Jira.

## 6. Release Plan & Milestones
*A high-level timeline for delivery.*

## 8. Appendix & Open Questions
*A place to track dependencies, assumptions, and questions that need answers.*

-   **Open Question:** What is the data retention policy for meeting transcripts? How long will they be stored and what are the user-configurable options?
-   **Open Question:** Which third-party speech-to-text engine provides the best balance of accuracy, speed, and cost for our needs?
-   **Open Question:** For the Facilitator agent, will prompts be sent privately to the quiet individual, to the meeting host, or be configurable?
-   **Dependency:** Legal and Security teams must approve the data privacy and storage policy before V1.0 development begins.
-   **Dependency:** Final UI/UX mockups for the live meeting dashboard are required from the Design team by Nov 15, 2023.
-   **Assumption:** We can secure API access and partnerships with Google and Microsoft for deep calendar integration.
